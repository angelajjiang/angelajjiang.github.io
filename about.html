            <h2 class="about-text"> Hi! My name is Angela Jiang. I'm originally from Kansas City, and I'm a rising junior at UC Berkeley studying computer science and economics. I'm especially interested in learning more about back-end development, ML/AI, and fintech, and I also have a passion for teaching. This summer I will be a TA for Discrete Math and Probability as well as a data science research intern at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. In my free time, I enjoy dance, tennis, and playing music. Some fun facts about me are that my favorite animal is a penguin, and I'm a huge foodie. Click on the icons to learn more about some of the organizations I'm involved in here at Berkeley.

          I am a junior mentor for CS 70. I teach a small section of students and help them with worksheets in discrete math and probability theory. I enjoy teaching CS, as it's kind of a way to give back to the community and help other succeed. I've also been an academic intern for 61A and 61B, as well as a CS mentor for high school students.

          I'm chair of the tech committee in PBL. We explore the intersection of business and technology by implementing technical projects such as data analysis and web development in a business context. PBL has been a lot of fun and I've learned a lot. Next semester I will be an internal networking chair.

          I'm a part of Fei Tian Dancers, the Chinese dance group at Berkeley. I've been dancing since I was really little, and I started Chinese dance in 5th grade. This semester we're doing an umbrella dance. I also enjoy lots of other different dance styles, like ballet, jazz, or urban. Last year I was also in AFX.

          In DSS, my team and I are analyzing a dataset about 911 calls and gun incidents in Oakland and applying data science skills such as Numpy, Pandas, and Seaborn in order to determine levels of safety in different areas and at different times.
